      <h3>Zeke</h3>
      <p>
        In June of 2023 he will turn 5 years old, and he is a mix of husky and
        Belgian Malinois. We are a family of 3 and soon we will be a family of
        4, Zeke will be the big brother. We live in Santa Cruz, California. Zeke
        is the most beautiful and sweet dog, he loves to sleep between my
        husband and I. Once per week he goes to a hike with a group of dog
        walker in our town. He loves to play in the water, ocean, creek, and
        rivers. He loves to play with another dogs and go to a run with his
        mom(me). For love, food, snuggles he always come to his mom, but for
        fun, craziness, meat treat of course he always go to his dad. Go back to
        the sliders, and check more pictures about Zeke and his family.
